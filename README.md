## Tutorial on Fisher Vectors

This code was used in the blog post ["What is a Fisher Vector for 3D point clouds - 3D Point Cloud Classification Primer"](http://www.itzikbs.com/what-is-a-fisher-vector-for-3d-point-clouds-3d-point-cloud-classification-primer). 


### Installation
You will need to have `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and of course `numpy` installed. 
You will also need `imageio` and `pickle`. 
The code was tested on Python 3.5.2 on Windows. 

### Usage
Simply run `main.py`. 

Change the function to run the different examples in 2D and 3D.
