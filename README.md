## Tutorial on Fisher Vectors

This code was used in the blog post ["What is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) - 3D Point Cloud Classification Primer"](https://wp.me/p8QHD6-9Z). 


### Installation
You will need to have `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and of course `numpy` installed. 
You will also need 'imageio' and 'pickle'. 
The code was tested on Python 3.5.2 on Windows. 

### Usage
Simply run `main.py`. 
Change the function to run the different examples in 2D and 3D.
